Lexiwin 8.1 - March 5, 2013
    - Modified the function that switch a window to the next monitor to fix a bug.
    - Modified the browse functionality with MButton & Wheel* to send the browse message to the window that is under the
        mouse pointer.
    - Modified the mouse part of the windows manager so that it is possible to close, minimize, maximize/restore, and
        switch screen with left, right, and middle mouse buttons continuously.
    - Removed Win + [left, right, and middle mouse buttons] because these shortcuts are no longer needed thanks to the
        mouse part of the Windows manager.
    - Replaced Win + B by Win + Alt + V to paste a FIFO element without formating (consistent with Ctrl + Alt + V for
        the classic clipboard).
    - Replaced CapsLock + Shift + A/Z/E/R/T/Y/U/I/O/P by CapsLock + Alt + A/Z/E/R/T/Y/U/I/O/P to paste without formating
        the content of a clipboard register.
    - Added CapsLock + C/X/V to copy/cut/paste, and CapsLock + Alt + V to paste without formating.
    - Added Win + F12 to terminate Lexiwin.
    - Removed the availability of terminating Lexiwin from clipboard menus.
    - Modified tooltips text in order to be more comprehensible.

Lexiwin 8.0 - February 4, 2013
    - Added Win + F1 to display quick help.
    - Added Win + F2 and Win + F3 to activate/deactivate the clipboard manager and the mouse part of the windows
        manager; these parameters are stored in the new ClipboardManager and WindowsManager sections in the
        configuration file.
    - Added Win + F4 to open the configuration file.
    - Added Win [+ Shift] + 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/0 to save and restore the active window's size and position; the saved
        sizes and positions are stored in the new WindowsManager section of the configuration file.
    - Modified quick launch management: now Lexiwin does not need to be restarted after changing quick launch lists in
        the configuration file; the number of each item is compute by Lexiwin at execution; and the syntax of the
        configuration file is "Pathx" and "Namex" (instead of "xPath" and "xName").
    - Modified the NumberOfCaches parameter in the configuration file: it has been moved from the General section to the
        ClipboardManager section.
    - Modified tooltips text in order to be more comprehensible.
    - Removed CapsLock + Ctrl + Wheel* for multimedia volume due to problems with fast scrolling.
    - Added #MaxHotkeysPerInterval 200 to prevent a warning dialog to be displayed while fast scrolling.
    - Modified Sleep duration from 100 to 50 ms between Send {Volume_*} and SoundGet.
    - For the portable version: the configuration file and the clipboard registers data are now read and write in the
